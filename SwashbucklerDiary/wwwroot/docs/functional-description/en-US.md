Function description

Swashbuckler Diary is an open source, cross platform local diary application. Half a lifetime of wind and rain, half a lifetime of travel, one's Jianghu, always needs to leave something to be wonderful.

Minimalism style, support page adaptation(Refers to multiple device sizes), support more languages, support Markdown, support WebDav backup, no need for networking, and all data is stored locally.

The function is very simple. I believe that you can use it very quickly if you are smart.
