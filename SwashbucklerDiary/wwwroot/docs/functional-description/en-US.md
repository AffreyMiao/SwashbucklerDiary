Function description

SwashbucklerDiary is an open source, cross-platform local diary app.

The function is very simple. I believe that you can use it very quickly if you are smart.

Emphasize!!! This is a special diary application, not a notepad, not a memo. Generally speaking, a diary should record important events of the day.
