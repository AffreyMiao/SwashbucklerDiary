Function description

Swashbuckler Diary is an open source, cross platform local diary application. Half a lifetime of wind and rain, half a lifetime of travel, one's Jianghu, always needs to be recorded to be wonderful.

Adhere to minimalism, support page adaptation, support Markdown, no need for networking, and all data is stored locally.

The function is very simple. I believe that you can use it very quickly if you are smart.
