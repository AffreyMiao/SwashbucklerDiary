# Update Announcement

[toc]

Hello, knights

Thank you to several heroes such as **俊, 小睡侠, 流浪者, 无名侠客, **亮 for their donations and encouragement. Special thanks

The development of the project cannot be separated from everyone's support. Interested friends can support it by [going to donate](sponsor)

This project has received its first PR submitted by other contributors, and we would like to express our special thanks to [Memoyu](https://github.com/Memoyu )

The focus of this issue is the update of privacy mode. Originally, privacy mode only supported diaries, but now it supports diaries, tags, files, locations, and more.

## New addition

* Desktop image preview supports mouse scroll zoom (from [Memoyu](https://github.com/Memoyu) the contribution)
* Add table button to toolbar
* Add audio and video auto play option [direct jump](diarySetting)
* Desktop add outline option [direct jump](outlineSetting)
* Privacy mode supports diary, tag, file, location [direct jump](privicyMode)

## Repair

* Cannot add files in formats such as. flac. mkv. gifv
* Clicking on the avatar incorrectly redirects to user settings
* The pop-up verification containing the form has failed
* The modification of displaying weather mood text did not take effect immediately in other pop ups
* Incorrect cursor position after inserting media file
* When in plain text mode, receiving files from shared sources generates an error message
* After adding tags and locations, they are not immediately displayed
* Export order error
* When restoring a backup, the old avatar may not have been deleted
* Incorrect writing to default settings during backup recovery
* Local area network transmission sequence error

## Optimization

* Update the icons of some buttons in the toolbar
* CSS styles related to the status bar take effect faster
* Ignore settings that may affect security when backing up or restoring backups
