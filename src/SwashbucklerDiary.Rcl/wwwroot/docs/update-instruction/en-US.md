# Update Announcement

Focus of this issue: Immersive status bar/navigation bar (more accurately, it should be called transparent status bar/navigation bar), basically no problem, but compatibility issues may occur on a few devices. If there are any issues, please provide feedback as soon as possible.

Updated privacy policy, please go to [privacy policy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yu-Core/SwashbucklerDiary/master/src/SwashbucklerDiary.Rcl/wwwroot/docs/privacy-policy/en-US.md) Or check the privacy policy within the app (using a universal template, if a certain app market says it doesn't match the actual situation, then remove the problematic ones)

## New addition

* Transparent status bar and navigation bar on mobile devices (immersive)
* On mobile devices, the dark mode on the web supports changing the status bar (requires browser support, Android Chrome and iOS Safari support, Edge does not support, and some browsers that use webview do not support it)

## Repair

* The user agreement and privacy policy URL address is incorrect
* The tag on the mobile reading diary page will appear as a shadow when long pressed
* Windows cannot select images in formats such as. webp and. jfif
* Unable to request local media files on the web side
* Incorrect language for web update announcement
* The height of the APP window is incorrect after input on the iOS end

## Optimization

* Automatically save when editing is enabled by default
* Remove some unnecessary prompts
* Default display of weather and mood icons on diary cards
* Markdown input experience
